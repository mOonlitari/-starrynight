<h1 class="content"> What we have learned in the Subject of ICT</h1>
<h2 p#"author"> by: Group 1</h2>
<p class="content">  As someone who's spent countless times on internet websites,
 the subject ICT has helped me to see web development
 as more than just markup and coding;it's an art form, a way of bringing ideas to life.
 In the first three quarters of ict subject , 
 I have learned a wide range of concepts and skills that have helped me better 
understand the world of technology and how it impacts our everyday lives. 
 From the basics of computer hardware and software to more advanced topics 
like programming and web development, I have gained a solid foundation in ICT that
 I can apply in various aspects of my life. </p>

<p class="warning"> One of the key things I have learned in my ICT  is the importance of computer literacy.
In today's digital age,having a basic understanding of how computers work and how to use 
them effectively is essential for success in almost any field. I have learned how to navigate different operating systems,
use common productivity tools like Microsoft Offic,and troubleshoot basic computer problems.
These skills have already proven to be valuable in my academic and personal life. </p>

<p class="warning"> In ICT i have learned about various uses and processes of how websites and webpages were made. 
Understanding how essential it is to secure data, networks, and computer systems from threats such as malware and phishing.
 And of course, knowing and understanding the elements, tags, attributes, and structures which make up HTML pages, 
as well as learning the principles of CSS, such as selectors, properties, and values, are also essential. </p>

<p class="warning"> On the previous lesson of ICT I learn a lot including how to style,
 add colors and do layout on html documents. These include the properties and values to change the format 
and style of a document.Also understanding ICT has a lot of benefits because it teaches us the things we must do on the internet and website. 
Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is one of the lesson in ICT and we tackle the parts of URL that help us to identify the
realiable sources of information online also each part has big role to secure the said address so it won't be easily access by other people. </p>

<p class="content">To sum up all of these, I can say that CSS and HTML are partners or duo in making a websites
 just like how our family accompanies us in our journey in life.
HTML represents us individuals it is the skeleton of the web page, this acquires the structure or coding of the websites.
This also include the paragraphs and images.CSS represents our family and love ones, they fills the missing parts,
CSS controls the presentation and styling of web pages. It allows developers to manipulate the appearance of HTML elements,
from the font and color to the layout and positioning. CSS gives web designers the power to create visually appealing 
and responsive designs that enhance the user experience and of course CSS brings more life in to the HTML. </p>
